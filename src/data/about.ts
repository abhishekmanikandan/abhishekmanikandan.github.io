I’m a Senior Software Engineer based in Vancouver, working at the intersection of full-stack engineering, applied AI, and distributed systems. I care about building technology that actually improves how people work and live — not just things that look impressive on paper.

Right now, I work at the Royal Bank of Canada in the HR AI Innovation Hub, where I prototype and ship agentic AI systems, internal RAG frameworks, and LLM-powered tools that help teams navigate the GenAI era. I enjoy taking ideas from rough sketches to production-grade systems, while keeping reliability, security, and human impact front and center.

Before RBC, I built and modernized large-scale platforms at Comcast, Ayogo Healthcare, and Sanmina. Along the way, I’ve worked on everything from micro-frontend architectures and serverless distributed systems to machine learning models for forecasting, ticket classification, and business automation. Some of my most meaningful work has been in healthcare and enterprise tooling — improving performance, privacy, and accessibility for people who rely on these systems every day.

I care deeply about mentorship and collective growth. I’ve led small engineering teams, mentored interns through production-ready AI projects, and enjoy helping others navigate both technical and career challenges. For me, engineering isn’t just about shipping features — it’s about building durable systems and empowering people to do their best work.

I’m currently focused on LLMOps, AI agents, and scalable system design. I’m always learning — from deep learning with PyTorch to modern ML and data infrastructure. I believe thoughtful engineering, done with humility and curiosity, can meaningfully improve society.

If you’re building something purposeful, exploring new ideas, or just want to exchange perspectives — I’d love to connect.

# Some History

- I studied Electronics and Communication Engineering at Anna University, which taught me how hardware, software, and systems thinking intersect.
- I moved to Canada to pursue a Master’s in Applied Computer Science at Dalhousie University, where I deepened my interest in distributed systems and applied AI.
- My early professional years were spent building full-stack platforms and microservices at Sanmina.
- At Comcast, I helped modernize large production frontends and contributed to ML models for forecasting and attrition analysis.
- At Ayogo Healthcare, I worked on serverless systems and performance optimization for a healthcare SaaS platform.
- Today at RBC, I design and prototype agentic AI tools, internal RAG frameworks, and GenAI-driven workflows.
